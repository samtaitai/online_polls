# online_polls
Online poll application built in Django

The base layer of this application is from Django official tutorial. I plan to add custom features like:
* Show most voted in the results page
* Vote is closed when it's due
* User can create a new poll onsite
* User can set as many choices as they want
* Share a poll via Twitter/Email
* ...more fun features!
