# online_polls
Online poll application built in Django

The base layer of this application is from Django official tutorial. I plan to add custom features like:
* Show most voted in the results page (done)
* Vote is closed when it's due (done)
* User can create & delete a new poll onsite (done)
* User can set as many choices as they want (done)
* User can delete polls (in progress)
* Share a poll via Twitter/Email
* ...more fun features!
